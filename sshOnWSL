To ssh using a config file in the ~/.ssh folder:
First create your key pairs and make sure you've installed the public on your host server (where ever that is).
Good Instructions are here: https://github.com/EasyCorp/easy-deploy-bundle/blob/master/doc/tutorials/remote-code-cloning.md#deploy-keys
 
Create the file with 600 permission:
touch ~/.ssh/config && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
Add more permissions:
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/config
Goto to ~/.ssh and run 
vi config
Using vi, add in the host information:
for ssh link example: ssh john@dev.example.com -p 2322, the config file would have:

Host dev
    HostName dev.example.com
    User john
    Port 2322

Install bitbucket ssh key pairs using instructions here:
https://github.com/EasyCorp/easy-deploy-bundle/blob/master/doc/tutorials/remote-code-cloning.md#deploy-keys
(while written for another purpose, the instructions works fine for this). The .ssh folder is in: 

C:\Users\Lars2-Daddy\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\tlarson\.ssh

and all the calls from Ubuntu shell should use this as default.
